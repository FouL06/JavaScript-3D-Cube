# JavaScript-3D-Cube
Creates a 3D cube using no added libraries and without assistance of Open GL. The program instead uses a canvas and media queries to project and manage the 3D cube. 
By performing matrix math and telling the webpage where to draw vertices and points we can then connect those points and draw faces.
